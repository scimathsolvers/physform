        <h1>Benign Beginnings</h1>
        <p>Physium Formulae began as a simple want for a faster way to do Physics homework, so <a href="https://github.com/PhysForm">@PhysForm</a> decided to build some solvers. These solvers were originally written in CP-Basic and were <i>extremely</i> slow and heavy on weight. The original solvers may be requested personally. 
          Since they were so heavy, <a href="https://github.com/PhysForm">@PhysForm</a> decided to turn to Hollyhock-2, which had a miserable failure. Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/PhysForm">@PhysForm</a> tried C#, fairing better and not returning to the project until the release of Hollyhock-3.
          The result is a now-in-progress project. Branching off into <a href="https://scimathsolvers.github.io/mathcalc/">Mathnasium Calculae</a></p>
